Feature: IoT Logger Battery Replacement

  Scenario: Logger Battery Level Monitoring and Replacement Indicator
    Given the IoT service has 30,000 assets across 1,000 locations
    And the battery replacement locations are dynamically set in the cloud platform
    And the battery level threshold is dynamically set
    When a logger's battery level falls below the threshold
    Then the system should indicate the low battery status
    And the LED should blink only if the logger is in a designated replacement location

# ### Why This Scenario:

# ## Critical Functionality: 
# # Focuses on the essential functionality of monitoring the battery level of loggers and the dynamic indication for battery replacement. 
#  This is a critical aspect as it directly affects the operational efficiency and reliability of the IoT service.

# ## Dynamic Configuration: 
# It tests the system's ability to handle dynamic settings for battery level thresholds and designated locations.

# ## Energy Efficiency: 
# The condition for the LED to blink only at specific locations is crucial for energy conservation, which is a concern for IoT devices.


# ### Other Scenario Considerations:
# 1 Data Transmission and Storage: Ingestion and storage of sensor data by the IoT service
# 2 Asset Tracking Across Locations: Cloud platform's capability to accurately track and display the status of all assets across multiple locations
# 3 Gateway-Logger Communication: Ensuring robust communication between loggers and gateways
